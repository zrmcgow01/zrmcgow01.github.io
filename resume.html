		<div id="employer">Sensata Technologies, Inc.</div><div id="position">Process/Electrical Engineering Intern, June 2012-August 2012; June 2013-August 2013</div>
		<ul id = "tasklist">
			<li>Process testing on high volume production machines used to calibrate pressure sensors (transducers) used on fuel rails, brake systems and fuel injection systems.  The focus of the project was to reduce the noise of the reference pressure signal by measuring the effects of different input parameters.</li>
			<li>Creation of programs to replicate the functionality of the timer/counter and analog input function of data acquisition cards currently in use in snap-sensor calibration for possible hardware/software conversion.</li>
			<li>Helped develop a training package for engineers and technicians on the use of SQL Server Management Studio to allow them to perform simple and complex queries of data in SQL databases.</li>
			<li>Failure analysis of high pressure application sensors facing field damages on a pin filter due to ESD damage.  Goal was to determine root cause off damage and review production process for risk mitigation suggestions.
