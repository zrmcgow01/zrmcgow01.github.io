Assignment 1
To my knowledge, all members of the assessment list have been completed and all guidelines were followed. 
 I briefly discussed CSS properties and other matters relating to the project with Corey Mason; other than
 that, all work done on this assignment was done by me alone.  I spent approximately 10 hours on this assignment. 
 My Github repo contains index.html, bio.html, resume.html, 4 pictures that are used in these pages, and two
 stylesheets.  indexstyle.css is applied to index.html, while linkfilestyle.css is the style sheet for the other 
 two html pages.  All .html and .css files are W3C validated.
